addNote
Creates a note using the given deck and model, with the provided field values and tags. Returns the identifier of the created note created on success, and null on failure.

Anki-Connect can download audio, video, and picture files and embed them in newly created notes. The corresponding audio, video, and picture note members are optional and can be omitted. If you choose to include any of them, they should contain a single object or an array of objects with the mandatory filename field and one of data, path or url. Refer to the documentation of storeMediaFile for an explanation of these fields. The skipHash field can be optionally provided to skip the inclusion of files with an MD5 hash that matches the provided value. This is useful for avoiding the saving of error pages and stub files. The fields member is a list of fields that should play audio or video, or show a picture when the card is displayed in Anki. The allowDuplicate member inside options group can be set to true to enable adding duplicate cards. Normally duplicate cards can not be added and trigger exception.
